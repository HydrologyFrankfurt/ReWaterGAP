WaterGAP is a state-of-the-art global-scale water resource and water-use simulation model. 
WaterGAP was used to support the sustainable development of the Earth system by assessing water scarcity for humans, drought hazards, ecologically-relevant streamflow characteristics, the impacts of human water use and dam construction as well as freshwater-related scenarios of the future [1]_. 
Recent focus has been on quantifying the impact of climate change on the global freshwater system, including the streamflow regime, groundwater recharge, floods, and droughts. 
WaterGAP is an open-source software with the aim of increasing reproducibility among researchers.


WaterGAP has been generally categorized into two sections: 

#. **WaterGAP framework** which consists of:
  
   * *WaterGAPUse* which includes the five sectoral water use models. 
   
   * *WaterGapCore* which includes the linking model Groundwater-Surface Water Use (GWSWUSE) and the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM).

#. **WaterGAPTools** consisting of *pre-processing* (input-generation) and *standard calibration* (against mean annual streamflow).
