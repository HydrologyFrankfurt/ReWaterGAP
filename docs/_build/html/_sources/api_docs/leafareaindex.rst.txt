.. _leafareaindex:

Leaf Area Index 
+++++++++++++++++++
Leaf Area index consists of two separate modules.

.. _parallel_lai:

1. Parallel Leaf Area Index 
============================
This module contains a daily leaf area index method which computes leaf area index per grid cell. 
This whole function is vectorized to compute leaf area index in parallel for all grid cell. using 
numpy vectorize function. 

.. automodule:: parallel_leaf_area_index
.. autofunction:: daily_leaf_area_index
     
2. Compute Leaf Area Index 
============================
This module consist of a class and related methods which calls the vectorized daily leaf area index  from the
:ref:`Parallel Lead Area Index <parallel_lai>` module.
In addition it parses  all input parameter and returns outputs variables (tuples) with  
days,cum_precipitation and growth_status (also known as state variables) updated daily.
