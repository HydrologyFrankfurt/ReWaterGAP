Running WaterGAP
================

The first step to running WaterGap is the download of all relevant data, code, dependencies and the creation of an environment. Find a detailed explanation on how to do this `here <five_minute_guide>`_ .

To check if the installation process has worked you can create a naturalizd run using this code:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ python3 run_watergap.py Config_ReWaterGAP.json

Standard WaterGap calibration
=============================

When running WaterGap you can calibrate the program to your specific needs by defining them in the master config file [here](../../Config_ReWaterGAP.json). If you change nothing you can run the simulation in its standard calibration. Alternatively you can change any number of options to calibrate to your specific needs. The following is a list of options, which may be changed.
