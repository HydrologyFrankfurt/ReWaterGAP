How to create an API page (e.g. River)
--------------------------------------

Styling Guide
*************
1. Naming the page
    The page needs a name which can be identified quickly out of a table of contents and found easily using the search function of the documentation. We use names such as "Snow" or "River" for API Docs relating to the storage of Snow and Rivers respectively. Also give a short description of what the doc is about, that helps a user determine if they found what they were looking for.

2. Link the function which is being described
    Calling a function into the documentation to give users an overview of parameters can be accomplished using the "autofunction" function

.. code-block:: bash
    .. autofunction:: snow.subgrid_snow_balance

Add GWSWUSE API to API
