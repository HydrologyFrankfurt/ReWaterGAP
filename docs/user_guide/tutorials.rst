Running Water Gap with different simulation options (other model configurations)
================================================================================

Naturalized Run
***************

This simulation computes naturalized flows and storages that would occur if there were neither human water use nor global man-made reservoirs/regulated lakes.

To run Water Gap in a naturalized mode, see :ref:`here <naturalized_run>`.

Standard anthropogenic Run
**************************

The standard run in WaterGAP simulates the effects of both human water use and man-made reservoirs (including their commissioning years) on flows and storages.

.. _human_water_use_only:

Human Water Use only 
********************

This simulation includes human water use but excludes global man-made reservoirs/regulated lakes.

.. _reservoirs_only:

Reservoirs only
***************

This simulation excludes human water use but includes global man-made reservoirs/regulated lakes.
