"""Groundwater balance."""

# =============================================================================
# This module computes groundwater balance, including groundwater storage
# and related fluxes for all grid cells based on section 4.5 of
# (Müller Schmied et al. (2021)).
# The groundwater balance equation is solved analytically for each timestep
# of one day to prevent numerical inaccuracies. This avoids the use of very
# small timesteps which will be computationally expensive and hence lead
# to numerical problems.
