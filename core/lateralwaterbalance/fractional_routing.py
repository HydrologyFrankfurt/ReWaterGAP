"Fractional routing"

# =============================================================================
# This module routes fractions of surface runoff and groundwater discharge
# to surface surface water bodies. This fractional routing scheme is based on
#  section of 4 and figuure 2. of (MÃ¼ller Schmied et al. (2021)  differs
# between (semi)arid and humid grid cells
